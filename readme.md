This a a repo to track our projects in the Data Science class.
I've included the database .tar file just for kicks.
All of the queries are named 'question set'_'question'_'version' with final being the formatted answer
and any alternateways of coding or testing labeled.
I'm sure there's a better way to do this but I'm really just trying to get Git practice...
